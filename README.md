Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the creation, scaling, and maintainance of software that solve real world problems and revolutionalize technological industry. For example ChatGPT it revolutionalizes the way research is done and assist rapid content creation.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Generative AI - systems that can create new content such as text generation, mage generation and even code generation based on training data.
Deep Learning - a subset of machine learning that utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to perform pattern recognition in data and analyze it.
Cloud engineering - it encompases the design and management of scalable cloud-based systems.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - Identify project goals, scope, purpose, resources, and timelines
Requirements Analysis - Gather and document the requirements from stakeholders. Understand the needs of potential uses.
Design - Create the design and architecture of the software.
Implementation - Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications.
Testing - Evaluate the software to identify and fix defects. (Unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing) to ensure the software meets the requirements. 
Deployment - Release the software to users. Installation, configuration and user training.
Maintenance - Ongoing support and updates to the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - writes the actual code based on the design requirements to create the software
Quality Assurance Engineer - Responsible for the quality of the software ensuring that it works as according to the design thus meeting the stakehoders expections or even exceeding them.
Project Manager - Makes sure the project timelines and resources are inline and are well utilized. He/She is responsible for the overal flow of the project ensuring that teams work together towards achieving the common goal.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - provides a suitable platform for writing code which caters for the appropriate syntax of the language in use eg, Visual Studio Code(VS Code), Atom, PyCharm
VLCS - provides platform where collaboration between developers is made possible through branches and pull requests, thus ensuring flow of project. eg github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Bugs - one way to solve this is making checkups on small chuncks of code use of print() to see if the code functions as intended. Also use of generation ai such as ChatGPT to point out where the bug is.
Changing Requirementd - requirements may evolve during the development process, leading to scope changes and potential rework. Agile methodologies are adopted to accommodated changes more efficiently through iterative development and regular feedback loops.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - testing functions of the software in isolation to verify that they work correctly. Importance - Early detection of bugs and fix.
Integration Testing - Focuses on the interactions between different modules or components of the software to ensure they work together seemlessly.
Importance - Identification of data flow problems or mismatched interfaces.
System Testing - Evaluates the entire software as a whole to verify that it meets specified requirements.
Importance - tests the entire application to validate it's overal behavior and performance.
Acceptance Testing - determines if the software meets the requirements of the end users and stakeholders.
Importance - Last line of defence before the deployment stage/phase


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
The practice of designing adn crafting efficient and specific queries/question to a large language model to ensure it gives the right an most suitable answer to user's request.
Importance - well stuctured queries ensure the model understands better and hence provides the appropriate response.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
what time did the man who ran the fastest in the world complete
What is Usain Bolt's record time for the 100 meters sprint.
The improved prompt specifies "Usain Bolt" making it clear which athlete the question refers to, whereas the vague prompt could lead to confusion about who is being asked about.
By also mentioning 100 meters sprint, the improved prompt narrows down the context of the question
